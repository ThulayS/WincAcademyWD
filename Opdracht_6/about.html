                    <h2>From home cook to blogger</h2>

                    <p>My name is Myrna and I am a passionate self-taught home cook, eating and cooking my way through
                        life.
                    </p>

                    <p>I was born in Spain and I was very fortunate to have 2 great cooks in my life one being Mum and
                        the
                        other, my
                        dad. Mum is English and from Manchester, and dad is Spanish and originally from a very small
                        village
                        called
                        Anchuras. We moved to England in the summer of '86 when I was 6 years old. Growing up with my
                        brother it was
                        Mum who would cook dinner for the family Monday â€“ Saturday and it was always homemade and always
                        fresh, but
                        when it came to Sunday that was Mum's day off from the kitchen and the apron would be handed
                        over to
                        Dad.
                        When Dad was cooking, you could always rely on it being a Spanish dish like paella or what he
                        would
                        call
                        mountain food; something like a huge pot of lentils, enough to feed the whole street or a
                        chicken
                        roast
                        dinner, but with his own little Spanish twist.
