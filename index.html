<h2>About</h2>
        <p>This was brought on to our menu as a vegan option for breakfast. It’s been flying off the pass to all of our customers, vegan or not, ever since, as an alternative to eggs. We serve it on thick slices of grilled sourdough bread with a fresh green salad alongside. It’s also lovely with a sprinkle of crispy fried shallots, if you are near an Asian supermarket. If you think you’ll get into the habit of making this for breakfast, double or quadruple the harissa onions: a batch keeps well in the fridge for around 5 days and turns this into a meal which can be ready in 5 minutes. Thanks to Claire Hodgson.</p>
